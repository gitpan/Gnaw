Revision history for Gnaw

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
	Basic grammars can be created and executed.
	The "commit" function is busted, though, and
	large chunks of the module may need to be rewritten
	to fix it. All the other functions seem to be doing 
	their job. Well, except for set_n, which is also
	broken, but fixing it probably won't require a massive
	module-wide rewrite.
